Roadmap
=========================

correlationMatrix aims to become the most intuitive and versatile tool to analyse discrete correlation data.
This roadmap lays out upcoming steps in this journey.

0.3.X
--------------------------

The 0.3.X family of releases will focus on rounding out a number of functionalities already introduced

- Stressing a set of multi-correlation matrices
- Comparing matrices produced by different estimation methods
- Further documenting the existing functionality
- Further tests, of both code and algorithms

Feature requests, bug reports and any other issues are welcome to log at the `Github Repository <https://github.com/open-risk/correlationMatrix>`_
