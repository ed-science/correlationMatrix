Intro
=========================
correlationMatrix is a Python powered library for the statistical analysis and visualization of timeseries correlation 
phenomena. It can be used to analyze any dataset that captures timestamped values (timeseries) 
The present use cases focuses on typical analysis of market correlations

You can use correlationMatrix to

- Estimate correlation matrices from historical timeseries using a variety of models
- Visualize correlation matrices
- Manipulate correlation matrices (fix problematic matrices etc)
- Provide standardized data sets for testing
