Intro
=========================
correlationMatrix is a Python powered library for the statistical analysis and visualization of state correlation 
phenomena. It can be used to analyze any dataset that captures timestamped correlations in a discrete state space. 
Use cases include credit rating correlations, system state event logs etc. 

You can use correlationMatrix to

- Estimate correlation matrices from historical event data using a variety of estimators
- Visualize event data and correlation matrices
- Manipulate correlation matrices (generators, comparisons etc.)
- Provide standardized data sets for testing
- Model correlations using threshold processes
